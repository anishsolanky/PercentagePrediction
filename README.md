# PercentagePrediction
This is the Task 1 of my internship at The Sparks Foundation , which is creating an supervised Machine Learning model for percentage predictions of a student while observing his or her study hours.

# Linear Regression Example

This repository contains a Python code example that demonstrates linear regression using scikit-learn library. The code performs the following tasks:

- Loads a dataset of student study hours and corresponding scores.
- Splits the data into training and test sets.
- Trains a linear regression model on the training data.
- Makes predictions on the test data and evaluates the model's performance.
- Provides an example of predicting the score for a given number of study hours.

## Installation

To run the code, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip: (as per requirement)

## Example

The code uses the following dataset: [Student Scores Dataset](http://bit.ly/w-data)

Running the code with this dataset will produce the following output:
... (output of the code)

No of Hours = 9.25
Predicted Score = [93.69173249]
